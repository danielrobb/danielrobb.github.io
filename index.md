I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Civil Engineering][civil] at [Queenâ€™s University][queens], where I study [sediment resuspension beneath internal solitary waves][aps] using high-resolution numerical simulations. I hold a PhD in [Environmental Fluid Mechanics][ubcefm] from the [University of British Columbia][ubc], where I investigated the [physical processes affecting turbidity][fate] in the surface waters of a glacier-fed hydroelectric reservoir. My research focuses on mixing and transport processes in inland and coastal waters, with implications for water quality, sediment dynamics and aquatic ecosystems.
