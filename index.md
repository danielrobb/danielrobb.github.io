I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Civil Engineering][civil] at [Queenâ€™s University][queens], where I investigate [sediment resuspension beneath internal solitary waves][aps] using high-resolution numerical simulations. I received a PhD in Civil Engineering ([Environmental Fluid Mechanics][ubcefm]) from the [University of British Columbia][ubc] in 2023, studying the [physical processes controlling turbidity][fate] in the surface waters of a glacier-fed hydroelectric reservoir. My research focuses on mixing and transport processes in inland and coastal waters, with applications to water quality, sediment dynamics, and broader ecological impacts on aquatic environments.
